## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## Thanks and credit

Thanks to [Daniel Tao for his `nearest-color` package](https://github.com/dtao/nearest-color) that has the algorithm to find the nearest colour.
